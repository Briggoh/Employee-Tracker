# Employee-Tracker
An application built with Node.

## Description 
The employee tracker is a command-line application that is meant to assist in the management of a company's employee database. More specifically, this application allows the user to view their employees, respective roles/job titles for such employees, their salaries, and who they are managed by.

- With the successful installation of node.js, then the user must clone this repo. In order to access the SSH key, click the green "code" button located above the documents/folders. 
- Then, the user must open the "index.js" file and take notice of where there is a password listed under the "create connection" function. The user should then erase the current listed password to their respective root user password of mysql DBMS.
- Upon completion of the previous step, the user must then install all of the required packages. This is done by opening an integrated terminal and running the code "npm i".
